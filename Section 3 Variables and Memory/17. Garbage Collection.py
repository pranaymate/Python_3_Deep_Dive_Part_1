# gc â€” Garbage Collector interface
# This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector.
# It provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection frequency
# and set debugging options. It also provides access to unreachable objects
# that the collector found but cannot free. Since the collector supplements
# the reference counting already used in Python, you can disable the collector
# if you are sure your program does not create reference cycles. Automatic
# collection can be disabled by calling gc.disable(). To debug a leaking
# program call gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK). Notice that this includes
# gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL, causing garbage-collected objects to be saved in gc.garbage
# for inspection.
